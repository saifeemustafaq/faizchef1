For the shopping cart experience, remove the edit and delete buttons. Implement an "Add" button inside each product card.

Each product card should include:
- Item name
- Store name
- Current unit (with a dropdown to change unit if needed)

At the lower section of the card:
- A numeric input box to enter quantity (numbers only)
- A dropdown (or similar selector) to change the unit, with the default unit pre-selected
- The "Add" button

When the user enters a quantity, selects the desired unit, and clicks "Add," that item should be added to the cart using the specified quantity and unit (e.g., "5 kg tomatoes" or "3 cases tomatoes"). Make sure the cart reflects the chosen unit for each addition. Users should be able to override the default unit before adding to cart.
